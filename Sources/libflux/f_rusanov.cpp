   * Recall that this is reduced to a one-dimensional computation along the normal of the mesh edge.\n
   * If the water heights on the two sides are small, there is no water.
   * Else, Rusanov formulation is used (see \cite Bouchut04):
   * \f[{\cal F}(U_L,U_R)=\frac{F(U_L)+F(U_R)}{2}-c\frac{U_R-U_L}{2},\f]
   * with \f$ c=\max\left(|u_L|+\sqrt{gh_L},|u_R|+\sqrt{gh_R}\right)\f$,
   * \f$U = {}^t (h,hu,hv)\f$ and \f$ F(U) = {}^t (hu, hu^2+gh^2/2, hv^2) \f$.
   * @param[in] h_L water height at the left of the interface where the flux is calculated.
   * @param[in] u_L velocity (in the x direction) at the left of the interface where the flux is calculated.
   * @param[in] v_L velocity (in the y direction) at the left of the interface where the flux is calculated.
