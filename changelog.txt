2013/04/23
- bug fixed: We resized the modified water height (hmod) and the infiltrated total volume (Vin) so that they are the same size of h because h receives a copy of hmod.
- bug fixed: At the order 2, the infiltrated total volume at the next time step must be computed with the infiltrated volume at the intermediate step (Vin1)
   and not only with the volume infiltrated corresponding at the initial step (Vin2). So, we replaced Vin2 by Vin1 in the function maincalcscheme.
   Furthermore, in the case of fixed cfl, we have added a initialization if verif==0 because we must restart from initial step (Vin2).

2013/03/08
